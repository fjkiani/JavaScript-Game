//prperties and tools learned
For this game, the main thing was learning the transitioning between players.
There is an active player state which tansitions to the other player when one of the player loses their turn. I also discovered sweetAlerts 
which are neat alert boxes. The game focuses on DOM and elements and leaves room for improvement. The improvement can be made by cleaning the code
with jQuery
